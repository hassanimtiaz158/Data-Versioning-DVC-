# Data Versioning with DVC

In this project, we demonstrated the use of **Data Version Control (DVC)** to manage and version datasets for machine learning workflows. The repository focuses on:

- Tracking datasets efficiently without bloating the Git repository.  
- Maintaining reproducibility of ML experiments by keeping code and data versions in sync.  
- Using lightweight metadata to monitor changes in data over time.  
- Enabling integration with remote storage to securely store large datasets.  
- Ensuring collaboration-friendly workflows where multiple users can work with the same datasets and code seamlessly.  

Overall, this project showcases how DVC simplifies dataset management and strengthens the reproducibility and maintainability of machine learning projects.
